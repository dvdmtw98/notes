Take up tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone  

Easy: Boredom  
**Challenging: Flow**  
Beyond our Abilities: Anxiety  

#### Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective

Vague Objective: Confusion, time wasted on meaningless task, Mental Block  
**Clear Well Defined Objective: Flow**  
Obsessive Desire to Achieve a Goal: Fixation of objective, Mental block

#### Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task
