title: TCP-IP Model
---

Also called the DoD model  

There are 2 versions of the TCP/IP Model:
* The 4 Layer one which is found in most of the IT related books (RF1122)
* The 5 Layer one which is newer and was made to align more with the OSI model. The Network Interface Layer is split into Data Link and Physical Layer (Not defined as an standard but considered valid)

![OSI Model Mapping to TCP IP Model](../images/mapping-between-osi-and-tcp-ip.jpg)

### Layer 1: Network Interface

Consist of the physical medium that interconnect computers  
Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals from the physical layer  
It is responsible for Hop to Hop Communication  

[Physical Layer Concepts](../layer-wise-concepts/physical-layer-concepts/physical-layer-concepts.md)  
[Data Link Layer Concepts](../layer-wise-concepts/data-link-layer-concepts/data-link-layer-concepts.md)

### Layer 2: Internet Layer

Responsible for End to End Communication  
Get data across a collection of network (across nodes)  
IP : Internet Protocol  
[Network (Internet) Layer Concepts](../layer-wise-concepts/network-layer-concepts/network-internet-layer-concepts.md)

### Layer 3: Transport Layer

Responsible for Server to Server Communication  
[TCP](../layer-wise-concepts/transport-layer-concepts/tcp-transmission-control-protocol.md): Transmission Control Protocol (Reliable Data Transfer)  
[UDP](../layer-wise-concepts/transport-layer-concepts/udp-user-datagram-protocol.md): User Datagram Protocol (Unreliable Data Transfer)  
RTP: Read Time Protocol (Video & Audio Transfer)

[Transport Layer Concepts](../layer-wise-concepts/transport-layer-concepts/transport-layer-concepts.md)

### Layer 4: Application Layer

The actual data generated by the source application is available at this layer
