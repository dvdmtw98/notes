### Protocol Data Unit (PDU)

A PDU is a single unit of information transmitted among entities of a computer network  
e.g. In Transport Layer when using TCP, the PDU is the segment 

### Internet Speed

ISP Speed : Mbps (Small b)  
Download Speed : MBps (Big B)

MBps to Mbps (Divide by 8)  
Mbps to MBps (Multiply by 8)
