title: Wide Area Network (WAN)
---

WANs connect smaller networks together (LANs, CANs, MANs)  
Covers an relatively large area (Countries, Cities)

### WAN Technologies

1. **<u>Circuit Switching</u>**  
   Was designed for telephone calls  
   Uses a dedicated point-to-point connection (Used very rarely for PC anymore)  
   A circuit guarantees you full bandwidth of the circuit and remain connected for duration of your call (When we are using the circuit no one else can use it)  
   The nodes had to be physically connected as with a dedicated electrical circuit (Earlier the circuits have to manually connected by cable operators)

2. **<u>Packet Switched Virtual Circuits</u>**  
   Modern networks make use of this approach  
   It makes use of virtual switches to provide end-to-end communication (Routers routes the packet in the network  
   The routing looking like a circuit is setup for that packet hence virtual circuit)  
   Data is moved in packets based on the destination address in each packet  
   The bandwidth and connection of the circuit is shared with other packets (This is why sometimes the internet speed can reduce at certain times)
