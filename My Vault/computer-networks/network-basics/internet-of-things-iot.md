Refers to the network of physical items with embedded systems that enables connection and data exchange

#### Hub
The central point connecting all IoT devices and sends commands to them

#### Smart Devices
Everyday objects enhanced with computing capabilities and Internet connectivity

#### Sensors
Detect changes in the environment and transform them into analyzable data

#### IoT Communication Technologies

##### 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
Wireless networks that can operate in Infrastructure mode or Ad hoc mode

##### Bluetooth
Low-energy technology  
Creates a mesh network

##### Radio-frequency Identification (RFID)
Uses electromagnetic fields to read data stored in embedded tags  
Allow for accurate scanning of items and sending data of up to 2 KB to a sensor at rapid speeds

##### Near-field Communication (NFC)
Enables two devices to connect within a 4cm range

##### Infrared (IR)
Operated with line of sight  
Used by very few IoT devices

##### Z-wave
Provides short range, low latency data transfer with slower rates and less power consumption that Wi-Fi  
Commonly found in home automation products

##### ANT+
Collection and transfer of sensory data  
Technology used to transfer data from sensors
