title: Network Geography
---

The key point to remember is the size/ distance of the devices which determines the network geography

### Personal Area Network (PAN)
Smallest type of wired or wireless network and covers the least  amount of area  
There usually cover 10 feet or less  
Bluetooth and even USB is considered a PAN

### Local Area Network (LAN)
Network in a small area (Small 1 floor office)  
Covers around 100 meters or 300 feet  
If CAT 5 cables are used each segment in the network cannot exceed 100 feet  
The devices in the network can be connected using [Ethernet](../layer-wise-concepts/data-link-layer-concepts/ethernet.md) (IEEE 802.3) or Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)

### Campus Area Network (CAN)
Connects LANs that are building centric across a university, industrial part of business park  
Can cover several miles  

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Connects scattered locations across city or metro area  
Up to 25 miles and/ or size of a city  

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
Connects geographically disparate internal networks and consists of Lease Lines and VPNs  
Country or Worldwide Network (The internet is considered a [Wide Area Network (WAN)](../wide-area-network/wide-area-network-wan.md))  
WAN networks don't have to public (Network to connect two offices present in different states)
