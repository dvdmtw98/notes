title: Layer 3 Switch
---

Provides the Layer 2 switching and the Layer 3 routing  
It is one device instead of separate [Router](router.md) and Switch  

They are always Managed Switches  
HSRP protocol can be configured on Layer 3 Switches  

L3 switches support creation of SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces)  
SVIs setup default gateway for each VLAN  
Because of this traffic can be routed between VLANs  

Not recommended in very large networks as dedicated routes are faster and more efficient
