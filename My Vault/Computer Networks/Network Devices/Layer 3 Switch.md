Provides the Layer 2 switching and the Layer 3 routing  
It is one device instead of separate [Router](Router.md) and Switch  

They behave exactly like a Router
Each port of the Layer 3 switch acts as its own Collision Domain and Broadcast Domain  

They are always Managed Switches  
It allows to create and routing packets between VLANs  
HSRP protocol can be configured on Layer 3 Switches  

Not recommended in very large networks as dedicated routes are faster and more efficient
