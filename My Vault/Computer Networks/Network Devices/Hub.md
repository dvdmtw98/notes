A Physical Layer (Layer 1) device that allows to connect network devices together  
Old device rarely used nowadays (Replaced by [Switch](Switch.md)es)  

It is also called Multi-Port [Repeater](Repeater.md) as traffic that is received a port and is repeated/ broadcasted to all port/ device connected to the Hub  
Because of this devices that are connected to an hub can see each others packets  
Hubs can lead to increased network errors (Collision Domain)

Hubs make use of Half Duplex Communication i.e. only one device can communicate at a time
