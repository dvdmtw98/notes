It uses "xx Base T" naming convention  
xx: Speed of the cable  
Base: Baseband communication (Single Frequency)  
T: Twisted Pair, F: Fiber Optic

| CAT 8                     | 40GBase-T  | 40 Gbps            | 30 meters  |

Only CAT 5 cables use TX to represent Twisted Pair Cable  
CAT 7 was released before CAT 6a and it supported using RJ-45 or Tera Connector
