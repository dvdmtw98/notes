The common cable that is used for network connections  
Four Twisted Pair of Wires with RJ-45 Connector  
Twisted to reduce interference (Crosswalk, EMI)  
Unshielded cable leak signals that can be used to construct the data

<u>CAT</u>  
CAT short for Category  
Higher number means more twists and supports faster speeds  
e.g. CAT 5, CAT 5e, CAT 6, CAT 6A

<u>Cabling Standards</u>  
TIA/EIA-568A & TIA/EIA-568B (Order of the wire in RJ-45 connector)

### Types

<u>Straight Through/ Patch Cable</u>  
568B standard on both the sides  
Used to connect unlike devices together (Computer to [Switch](../../../Network%20Components/Switch.md), Switch to [Router](../../../Network%20Components/Router.md))

<u>Crossover Cable</u>  
Different standards on both the ends  
Used to connect like devices together (Router to Router, Computer to Computer)
