Numeric values are always right aligned. This is done so that floating point numbers will have the decimal points neatly aligned one below the other

Date values are also internally treated as numeric type so even they are right aligned. The default format is MM/DD/YYYY (It can defer from region to region)

When the column is too small to show a numeric value (Date values as well) it is represented using the # symbol  
String values get cut of if it cannot fit the cell
