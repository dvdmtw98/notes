Staging Area is an intermediate stage to which we decide and add files that will be committed/ added into the repo

````bash
# Add a file to staging area
git add <file-name> 

# Add all files in folder to staging area
git add . 		

# Interactively select part of file that needs to be committed
git add -p <filename> 			
````
