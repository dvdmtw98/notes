### Best Practices & Coding Conventions

Variable, Function Names : Camel Case  
Constants : Upper Snake Case  
Class Name : Pascal Case

### Miscellaneous Points

* Before ES6 variables where function scoped in JS
* Var gets hoisted to global scope when used in for loop declaration
* Closure is an function and its environment (variables on which the function depends)
* **Primitive Datatypes**: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol & **Non-Primitive Datatype**: Object
* 0 in front of a number in JS means its in octal (Wont work in strict mode)
