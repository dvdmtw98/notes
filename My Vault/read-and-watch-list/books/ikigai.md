### Find Flow in Everything you do

**Flow State**: Pleasure, delight, creativity and process when we are completely immersed in life

When we are in the flow state our mind is "in order". The opposite happens when we try to do something when our mind is on other things.

**<u>The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow</u>**
* Knowing what to do
* Knowing how to do it
* Knowing how well you are doing
* Knowing where to go
* Perceiving significant challenges
* Perceiving significant skills
* Being free from distractions

#### Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too difficult!)  
Take up tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone  

Easy: Boredom  
**Challenging: Flow**  
Beyond our Abilities: Anxiety  

#### Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective

Vague Objective: Confusion, time wasted on meaningless task, Mental Block  
**Clear Well Defined Objective: Flow**  
Obsessive Desire to Achieve a Goal: Fixation of objective, Mental block

#### Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task
Our brains can take millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. When we say we're multitasking what we're really doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly.

Studies have shown that working on multi tasks at the same time can reduce our productivity by at least 60 percent or by 10 IQ points.

### The Ikigai Diet

Japan has the highest life expediency in the world: 85 years for men and 87.3 years for women

#### Okinawa's Diet Miracle

* Locals eat a wide **variety** of foods, especially vegetables. They eat a average of eighteen different food each day
* They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. On a daily basis they consume at least 7 types of fruits and vegetables
* Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every day sometimes with noodles
* They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it's **cane sugar**
* Okinawans eat fish an average of three times per week, unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequent consumed meat is fork

Additionally,
* Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of Japan's population (sweets and chocolates are very rare)
* They eat half as such salt as the rest of Japan; 7 grams per day compared to the average of 12 grams
* They consume fewer calories, an average of 1785 per day, compared to 2,068 in the rest of Japan

The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating food with a high nutritional value and avoiding those that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value. If we regularly consume too much calories

**Sanpin-cha**: A mix of green team and jasmine flowers is consumed by Okinawan's almost three times daily. Green tea has proven to reduce the free radicals present in our bodies, keeping us young longer

### Resilience and Wabi-sabi

**Resilience** is our ability to **deal** with **seatbacks**. The more resilient we are, the more easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our lives.

Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is there source of strength. They concentrate on the things they an control and don't worry about those they can't.

**Ascetic**: Person who lives life by leaving behind all worldly pleasures  
**Cynics**: People who lead Ascetic lives  
**Stoics**: There is nothing wrong with enjoying lives pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them

We finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a better one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can't live without a sailboat.  

The Stoics believed this kind of desires and ambitions are not worth pursuing. The objective of a virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility. In order to keep their minds virtuous, they practiced negative visualization. They imaged the worst that could happen in order to be prepared for the worst.

Other central tenet of Stoicism is knowing **what we can control and what we cannot can't**. Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing.

Both Stoicism and Buddhism reminds us that the present is all that exists, and its is the only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now. Stoics also recommend reflecting on the impermanence of the things around us.
