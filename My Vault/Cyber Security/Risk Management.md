Process that involves identifying, analyzing, treating, monitoring and reporting risks

### Risk Assessment Frequency
The regularity with which risk assessments are conducted within an organization

##### Ad-Hoc Risk Assessments
Conducted as and when needed, often in response to a specific event or situation that has the potential to introduce new risks or change the nature of existing risks

##### Recurring Risk Assessments
Conducted at regular intervals, such as annually, quarterly or monthly  
e.g. Penetration Testing   

##### One-Time Risk Assessments
Conducted for a specific purpose and are not repeated  
e.g. New IT system, Organizational change

##### Continuous Risk Assessments
Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risks

### Risk Identification
Recognizing potential risks that could negatively impact an organizations ability to operate or achieve its objectives  
It is a proactive process and can involve Brainstorming, Checklists, Interviews, Scenario Analysis  
Organization should consider a wide range of risks, including operational, financial, strategic and reputational risks

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organization's business functions and processes

##### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
Maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severely impacts the organization  
Target time in which a business must be restored to its normal operation to avoid negative consequences

##### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time  
Point in time at which data must be restored to continue normal operation

##### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
The average time required to repair a failed component or system

##### Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)
The average time between failures

### Risk Register (Risk Log)
A document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact likelihood and mitigation strategies

##### Risk Description
Entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk

##### Risk Impact
Potential consequences if the risk materializes

##### Risk Likelihood/Probability
Chance of a particular risk occurring

##### Risk Outcome
Result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood

##### Risk Level/Threshold
Determined by combining the impact and likelihood

##### Cost
Financial impact on the project, including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of risk mitigation

##### Risk Owner
Person or group responsible for managing the risk

### Risk Appetite
Signifies an organization's willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals  
Maximum amount of risk they are prepared to accept  

##### Expansionary Risk Appetite
Organization is open to taking more risk in the hopes of achieving greater returns

##### Conservative Risk Appetite
Organization favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns

#####  Neutral Risk Appetite
Signifies a balance between risk and return

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
Essential predictive metrics used by organizations to signal rising risk levels in different parts of the enterprise  
Allows organizations to evaluate the impact and likelihood of risks, allowing proactive management to prevent their escalation

### Qualitative Risk Analysis
A method of assessing risks based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence  
Subjective and relies on the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders

### Quantitative Risk Analysis
Method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measurements

##### Exposure Factor (EF)
Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event  
Represented as a percentage between 0% (No Loss) and 100% (Total Loss)

##### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event  
SLE = Asset Cost x EF

##### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year

##### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected annual loss from a risk  
ALE = SLE x ARO

### Risk Management Strategies

##### Risk Transference (Risk Sharing)
Shifting the risk from the organization to another party

**Contract Indemnity Clause**  
A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the others harm, liability or loss stemming from the contract

##### Risk Acceptance
Recognizing a risk and choosing to address it when it arises  
No action is taken against the risk

**Exemption**  
Provision that grants an exemption from a specific rule or requirement

**Exception**  
Provision that permits a party to bypass a rule or requirement in certain situations

##### Risk Avoidance
Strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific risk

##### Risk Mitigation
Implementing measures to decrease the likelihood or impact of a risk

---

### Risk Monitoring
Continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plans and evaluating their effectiveness during a projects lifecycle

##### Residual Risk
Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation, transference or acceptance measures on the initial risk

##### Control Risk
Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time

##### Risk Reporting
Process of communicating information about risk management activities  

Helps to:
- Informed Decision-Making  
- Risk Mitigation  
- Stakeholder Communication  
- Regulatory Compliance
