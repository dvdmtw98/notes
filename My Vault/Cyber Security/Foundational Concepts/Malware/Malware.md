Software designed to infiltrate a computer system and possibly damage it without the user's knowledge or consent

#### Virus
Code that runs on the machine without the user's knowledge and infects the computer
Viruses require **user action** to reproduce and spread

**Boot Sector**  
Stored in the first sector of the hard drive and loaded into memory on system boot  
Very difficult to detect

**Macro**  
Code embedded into a document that is executed when opened by the user

**Program**  
Infects executables or applications

**Multipartite**  
A virus that combines boot and program viruses  
It attaches itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files

**Encrypted**  
Uses cipher to encrypt the content of itself

**Polymorphic**  
Advanced version of an encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection

**Metamorphic**  
Type of virus that can rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a file  
It is an advanced version of the polymorphic virus

**Stealth**  
A virus that uses different techniques to hide from antivirus software  
Encrypted, Polymorphic and Metamorphic viruses are classified as Stealth Viruses

**Armored**  
A virus that has a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it

**Hoax**  
Not a virus, it is an attempt (Social Engineering) to get the user to install a virus on their system

#### Worm
Malicious software that is like a virus but can replicate itself without any user interaction 
Worms can disrupt normal network traffic and computing activities  
Exploits security vulnerabilities to spread and replicate

#### Trojan Horse
Malicious software that is disguised as a piece of harmless software or desirable software

**Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: Providers the attacker with remote control of a victim's computer and is the most commonly used type of trojan

#### Ransomware
Uses a vulnerability in your software to gain access and then encrypts the files  
Form of Blackmail and Extortion

#### Spyware
Malware that secretly gathers information about the user without their consent  
Could sometimes captures users keystrokes (keylogger) and take screenshots that are then sent to the attacker

**Adware**: Displays ads based on the information its spying from you  
**Grayware**: Software that isn't benign or malicious and tends to behave improperly without serious consequences

#### Rootkit
Software designed to gain administrative level control on the system without detection  
Uses DLL Injection & Driver Manipulation to establish persistence  
Rootkits are loaded before booting the OS and are difficult to detect

**DDL Injection**: Malicious code is inserted into a running process by taking advantage of DDLs that are loaded at runtime  
**Driver Manipulation**: An attack relies on compromising the kernel-mode device drivers that operate at a privileged or system level

Both the above attacks are achieved using a shim. A shim is an interface that is placed between two components to intercept calls and redirect them

#### Spam
Activity that abuses the electronic messaging system  
Spammers often exploit a companies  open mail replays to send their messages

**SPIM**: Spam Over Instant Messaging

#### Botnets & Zombies

**Botnet**: A collection of compromised devices under the control of a master node  
They are great for anything that is processing intensive

**Logic Bomb**  
Malicious code that has been inserted into the program that is only executed when a certain condition is met

#### Removing Malware


Identify symptoms of a malware infection  
Quarantine the infected systems  
Disable System Restore (only Windows Machine) - User may select a infected restore point
Remediate the infected system (Malware removal techniques)  
Schedule automatic updates and scans  
Enable System Restore - Create a new restore point  
Provide end user security training

Ensure we have a good backup  
Boot Sector Virus requires rebooting the computer from an external drive to scan
