#### Geographic Restrictions (Geofencing)
Involves setting up virtual boundaries to restrict data access based on geographic locations

#### [Encryption](../Cryptography/Encryption.md)
Process of converting ordinary information (plain text) into unintelligible form (cipher text) 
Most encryption algorithms that are used today are open source and publicly accessible  
The key is what makes the algorithm strong. Longer the key the stronger the security  

#### [Hashing](../Cryptography/Hashing.md)
Technique that converts data into a fixed size of numerical or alphanumeric characters  
It is a one-way function

#### [Obfuscation](../Cryptography/Obfuscation.md)
Make the data unclear or unintelligible, making it difficult for unauthorized users to understand

#### Segmentation
Involves dividing a network into separate segments, each with its own security controls

#### Permission Restrictions
Involves defining who has access to specific data and what they can do with it  
e.g. [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](../../Cloud%20Service%20Providers/Azure/Azure%20Security%20Services/Role%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(RBAC).md)
