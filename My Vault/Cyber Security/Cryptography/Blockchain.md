### Public Ledger
A record-keeping system that maintains participants identities in a secure and anonymous format

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts where the terms of agreement or conditions are written directly into lines of code  
Can automatically perform actions when certain conditions are met  
Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered, making the agreement tamper-proof and trustworthy
