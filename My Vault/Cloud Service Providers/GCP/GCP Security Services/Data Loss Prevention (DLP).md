---

Fully managed service designed to help you discover, classify, and protect your most sensitive data  
Reduce data risk with obfuscation and de-identification methods like masking and tokenization

DLP provides various approaches to de-identify data:

* **Masking** : Hide the sensitive data using symbols and surrogate value
* **Redaction** : Remove the sensitive data
* **Replacement** : Hide data using a surrogate value
* **Crypto based Tokenization** : Encrypt the data using hashing algorithms
* **Bucketing** : Segregate the data into groups (Generalize the data)
* **Data Shifting** : Shift data values by a random amount
* **Time Extraction** : Preserve specific portions of the date
