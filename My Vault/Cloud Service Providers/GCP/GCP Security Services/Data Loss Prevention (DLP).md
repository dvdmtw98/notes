Monitor the data of a system while in use, transit or at rest to detect attempts to steal data
It is a service designed to help discover, classify, and protect our most sensitive data  
DLP can be an software or hardware solution

#### Endpoint DLP System  
Software that monitors the data in use on a computer and can stop malicious activities or alert an administrator of the occurrence

#### Network DLP System
Software or hardware-based system that is installed on the perimeter of the network to detect data in transit

#### Storage DLP System
Software installed on servers in the data centers to protect data at rest

#### Cloud DLP System
Cloud SaaS that protects the data being stored in the cloud

#### Data Protection Techniques

* **Masking**: Hide the sensitive data using symbols and surrogate value
* **Redaction**: Remove the sensitive data
* **Replacement**: Hide data using a surrogate value
* **Crypto based Tokenization**: Encrypt the data using hashing algorithms
* **Bucketing**: Segregate the data into groups (Generalize the data)
* **Data Shifting**: Shift data values by a random amount
* **Time Extraction**: Preserve specific portions of the date
