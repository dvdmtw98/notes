title: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
---

It is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network

A common use of LDAP is to provide central place to store usernames and passwords

LDAP enables use of same-sign on  
Same-sign on allows users to use a single ID and password, but they need to enter it every time they have to login

### LDAP vs. SSO

Most SSO systems are using LDAP under the hood  
LDAP was not designed to work naively with web-applications  
LDAP is mostly found on on-premises and DevOps workloads  
Some systems only support integration with LDAP and not SSO
