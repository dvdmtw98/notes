title: Google Cloud for Government
---

### GovCloud

An isolated region to run [FedRAMP](../GCP%20Security%20Services/GCP%20Compliance%20Standards.md#federal-risk-and-authorization-management-program-fedramp) workloads  
These types of clouds generally have a smaller service offering, lower service availability and higher operational costs

### GCP Approach

GCP allows [FedRAMP](../GCP%20Security%20Services/GCP%20Compliance%20Standards.md#federal-risk-and-authorization-management-program-fedramp) workloads to run in its normal user regions  
This approach mitigates the issues of other GovCloud offerings  
GCP Regions will be authorized for either High or Moderate baselines
