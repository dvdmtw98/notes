It is a modern application management platform used for managing hybrid architectures that span from Google Cloud to other CSPs or on-premise datacenters

Anthos allows to develop an application once and run it anywhere (on-prem, public cloud, private cloud)

Anthos is a single control place to manage Kubernetes compute in hybrid scenarios
It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure so that the developers only need to focus on management of the applications

Core components of Anthos:

* Infrastructure, Containers and Cluster Management
* **Managed Service Mesh** (Visually view resources)
* Multi-cluster Management
* Configuration Management
* Migration
* Service Management
* Serverless
