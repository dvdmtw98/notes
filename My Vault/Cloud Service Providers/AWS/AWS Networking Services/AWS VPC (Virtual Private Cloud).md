VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section in the AWS cloud where we can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that we define

An VPC can be spread across multiple availability zones in a region  
VPC are broken down into smaller chunks called as subnets

When we create an custom VPC we need to explicitly configure subnets, NAT, security groups, internet gateway, etc.

---

### Internet Gateway & NAT
Allows routing of traffic onto the public network

### DNS
Converts the domain name into IP address

### Elastic IP
It is an static IP that never changes

### VPC Endpoints
Private connection between VPC and other AWS resources without using the internet

### Network Interface
A point of connection between an public and a private network

### Route Tables
Defines how the connection is routed between each subnets

### VPC Peering
Connection between VPCs
