![Redshift Architecture|500](../../images/redshift_architecture.png)

Redshift is an collection of compute resources which we call nodes  
A group of nodes is called a cluster

Each cluster runs AWS Redshift engine and each cluster has 1 or more DBs  
Each cluster has Leader Node and Compute Nodes

Leader Node receives the query from client applications and creates an query plan  
The query plan is then executed by the compute nodes and the final result is aggregated by the leader node which sends the final result to the clients

The compute nodes can transfer data between themselves  
Compute Nodes are further divided into Node slices. Slice is an logical partition for disk storage  
Each slice consist of this own set of data

The clients communicate with Redshift using JDBC/ OBDC drivers

 > [!NOTE]
 > * The Leader node of Redshift is designed based on PostgreSQL
 > * So the same way we communicate with PostgreSQL we can communicate with Redshift

### Leader Node

SQL endpoint  
Stores metadata  
Coordinates parallel SQL processing

### Compute Node

Local, Columnar Storage  
Execute query in parallel  
Load, Backup, Restore

### Node Types

Dense Storage (DS2, RA3) - HDD  
Dense Compute (DC2) - SDD
