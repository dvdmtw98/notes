6 Pillars: IDEA-IN  

Verify Explicitly: AuthN (Authentication) + AuthZ (Authorization)  
Least Privilege: JIT & JeP  
Assume Breach: Segment Network, Encryption, Detect Threats

**JIT (Just-in-time)**: Given access to a resource only during the time when it is needed  
**JeP (Just enough Privilege)**: Give access to only the specified access (API calls)

### Defense in Depth

Data: Encryption  
Application: Secure & free of vulnerability  
Compute: Access to VM  
Network: Limit communication using segmentation & access control  
Perimeter: DDoS Protection  
Identity & Access: Controlling access to Infrastructure  
Physical: Limit access to Datacenter
