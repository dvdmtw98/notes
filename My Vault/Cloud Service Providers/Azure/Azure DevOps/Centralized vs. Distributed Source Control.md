### Centralized Source Control

Scales to very large codebases  
Granular file access control  
Allows usage monitoring  
Allows to lock file exclusively (Only 1 person can work on a file)

e.g. SVN, PVCS, Source Safe, Team Foundation Server (TFS)

### Distributed Source Control

Fully offline experience & Extremely fast  
Complete repository with portable history  
Cross platform support  
Pull requests for code review

e.g. Mercurial, Git
