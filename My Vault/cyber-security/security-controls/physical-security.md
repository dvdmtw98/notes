### Fences & Bollards

**Fences**  
Provides a visual barrier by defining a boundary  
Physical boundary against unauthorized access  
Delay Intruders giving security professionals time to react  

Trespassing, Theft, Vandalism, Unauthorized Facility Access

**Bollards**  
Short vertical posts designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic
Creates a physical barrier from potential vehicular collision  
Visual reminder of where vehicles are not permitted  

ASTM F2656-07 M30 P1: Can stop a 15,000 pound vehicle travelling at 30 mph and not allow it to move more than 1 meter

### Brute Force

**Forcible Entry**  
Reinforced or laminated windows  
High-strength doors with deadbolt locks, metal frames or solid cores

**Tampering with Security Devices**  
Implement redundancy in security measures

**Confronting Security Personal**  
Rigorous training in conflict resolution and self-defense training

**Ramming a Barrier with a Vehicle**  
Reinforced barriers & Bollards

### Surveillance Systems

**Video Surveillance**  
Motion Detection, Night Vision, Facial Recognition, Remote Access  
Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ): Can move camera or its angle to better detect issues  
Detective Security Control

**Security Guards**  

**Lighting**  
Motion activated lights can act as a deterrent and alert system

**Sensors**  
IR Sensors: Good for low light or dark conditions, Change in body heat  
Pressure Sensors: Unauthorized Entry  
Microwave Sensors: Movement Detection  
Ultrasonic Sensors: Automated Doors, Movement Detection

#### Bypassing Surveillance Systems

**Visual Obstruction**: Blocking Camera's Line of Sight  
**Blinding Sensors or Cameras**: Overwhelm camera with light  
**Acoustic Interference**: Jamming or playing loud music to disrupt microphone  
**Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**: Jamming frequencies used by the systems  
**Physical Environment Attack**: Attack power supplies, start fire, damage equipment  

### Access Control Vestibule
Double-door system that is designed with two doors that are electronically controlled to ensure that only one door can be opened at a given time

**Piggybacking**: Person with authorized access allows another person without authorization to enter an secure area with them  
**Tailgating**: Unauthorized person follows someone with legitimate access to a secure space without their knowledge or consent
