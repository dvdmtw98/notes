#### Preparation
Involves strengthening systems and networks to resist attacks  
This phase is about getting ready for future incidents

#### Detection
Identifies security incidents

#### Analysis
Involves a thorough examination and evaluation of the incident  
Stakeholders are informed, containment begins and initial response actions are taken

#### Containment
Limit the incidents impact by securing data and protecting business operations

#### Eradication
Starts after containment and aims to remove malicious activity from the system or network

#### Recovery
Restores systems and services to their secure state after an incident  
e.g. Restoring Backups, Installing Patches, Implementing Security Configuration

#### Post-Incident Activity
Happens after containment, eradication and full system recovery  

##### Root Cause Analysis
Identifies the incidents source and how to prevent it in the future

Steps Involved:
* Define the scope of the incident  
* Determine the causal relationships  
* Identify an effective solution  
* Implement and track the solution

##### Lesson Learned Process
Document experiences during incidents in a formalized way

##### After-action Report
