Similar to BCP but applies to IT assets  
Unlike BCP, DRP is more granular and has details for specific systems  
Should be reviewed and updated at least every 12 months

#### DRP Lifecycle

##### Mitigation
Reduce the impact and lifelikeness of a disaster  
Pre-disaster mitigation implementation

##### Preparation  
Build programs, procedures and tools for our response

##### Response
How we react in a disaster, following the procedures

##### Recovery
Reestablish basic functionality and get back to full production

##### Lesson Learned
Document experiences during incidents in a formalized way

---

#### Simulated Tests

##### DRP Review
Team members who are part of the DRP team review the plan quickly looking for glaring omissions, gaps or missing sections in the plan

##### Read-Through (Checklist)
Managers and functional areas go through the plan and check a list of components needed for in the recovery process

##### Tabletop Exercise (Structured Walkthrough)
A group of managers and critical personnel sit down and talk through the recovery process

##### Simulated Test (Walkthrough Drill)
The team simulates a disaster and the teams respond with their pieces from the DRP

#### Physical Tests

##### Partial Interruption
