Proactively searching for cyber security threats that might be lurking undetected in the organizations network  
Allows to improve detecting capabilities, reduce attack surface, block attack vectors, identify critical assets

#### Threat Hunting Steps

##### Establish a Hypothesis
Predicting high-impact, likely events through threat modeling

##### Profiling Threat Actors and Activities
Envisioning how potential attackers might intrude and what they aim to achieve

When threat hunting we need to assume that all the existing security controls have failed  
This is what differentiates normal network monitoring from threat hunting

#### Gathering Threat Intelligence

##### Advisories and Bulletins
Published by vendors and security researchers when new TTPs and vulnerabilities are discovered

##### Intelligence Fusion and Threat Data
Use SIEM and analysis platforms to spot concerns in the logs and real-world security threats
