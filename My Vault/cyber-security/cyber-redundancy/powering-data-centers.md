### Power Protectors

#### Line Conditioner
Used to overcome any minor fluctuations in the power being received by the given system

#### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
A device that provides emergency power to a system when the normal input power source has failed

#### Generator
Machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy got use in an external circuit through the process of electromagnetic induction

Portable Gas Generator  
Permanently Installed Generator (Gas powered)  
Battery Inverter Generator

#### Power Distribution Center (PDC)
Acts as a central hub where power is received and then distributed to all systems in the data center
