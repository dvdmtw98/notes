Enables efficient network configuration to improve performance and monitoring  
Uses an standardized platform that provides centralized view of the network  
Decouples the networking and forwarding functions  
The networking functions are programmable  
The underlying infrastructure is abstracted for clients and services

#### Data Plane
Also called the forwarding place  
It is responsible for handling the packets and makes decisions based on protocols

#### Control Place
The brain of the network that decides where the traffic is send  
It is centralized in SDN

#### Application Plane
The plane where all network applications interacting with the SDN controller reside
