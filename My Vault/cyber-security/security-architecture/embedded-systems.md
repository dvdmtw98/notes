Specialized computing component designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger structure  
They generally have long operational life and are deployed in harsh environments

#### System Risks and Threats

* Hardware Failure
* Software Bugs
* Security Vulnerabilities
* Outdated Systems

#### Protection Techniques

##### Network Segmentation
Divide the network into multiple segments or subnets to limit potential damage

##### Wrappers
Show only the entry and exit points of the data when travelling between networks  
e.g. IPSec (If data is captured only IPSec Headers are visible)

##### Firmware Code Control
Utilize secure coding practices, code reviews and automated testing

##### Inability to Patch
Strategies like OTA updates can be used to install updates remotely

#### Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
Ensures data processing in real-time and is crucial for time-sensitive applications  
e.g. Flight Navigation Systems, Medical Equipment, Data Transfer Systems
