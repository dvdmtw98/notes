### Qualitative Risk Analysis
A method of assessing risks based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence  
Subjective and relies on the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders

### Quantitative Risk Analysis
Method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measurements

##### Exposure Factor (EF)
Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event  
Represented as a percentage between 0% (No Loss) and 100% (Total Loss)

##### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event  
SLE = Asset Cost x EF

##### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year

##### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected annual loss from a risk  
ALE = SLE x ARO
