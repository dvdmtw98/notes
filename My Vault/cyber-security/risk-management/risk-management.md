#### Risk Management
Process of finding ways to minimize the likelihood of an undesirable outcome from occurring so that the desired outcomes can be reached  

[Threats and Vulnerabilities](../general-concepts/threats-and-vulnerabilities.md)

Risk = Threat \* Vulnerability (or Likelihood)  
Risk = Threat \* Vulnerability \* Impact  

Total Risk = Threat * Vulnerability \* Asset Value  
Residual Risk = Total Risk - Countermeasures
