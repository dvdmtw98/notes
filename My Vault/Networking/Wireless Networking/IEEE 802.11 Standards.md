| IEEE Standard | Max Theoretical Speed | Frequency     |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 802.11        | 2Mbps                 | 2.4GHz        |
| 802.11a       | 54Mbps                | 5Ghz          |
| 802.11b       | 11Mbps                | 2.4Ghz        |
| 802.11g       | 54Mbps                | 2.4Ghz        |
| 802.11n       | 600Mbps               | 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz |
| 802.11ac      | 866.7Mbps             | 5Ghz          |

802.11b made use of DSSS to improve the speed. Brough support for channels  
802.11n makes use of MIMO technology. Uses multiple antenna that increased the range  
802.11ac also uses MIMO technology. It was made to reach wired network speeds on wireless networks
