A Physical Layer (Layer 1) device that allows to connect many devices together  
Old device rarely used nowadays (Replaced by [Switch](Switch.md)es)  
It is a Multi-Port [Repeater](Repeater.md) (Traffic that is input on one port and is repeated on every other port/ device connected to the Hub)

All the devices that are connected to an hub can see each others packets
This causes a lot of noise (Collision Domain)

Hubs make use of Half Duplex Communication
