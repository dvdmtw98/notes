title: AC & DC Current
---

Current is generally transported from the source to our houses using AC current  
As there are easy to step-up and step-down the voltage using [Transformers](components/transformers.md)  
They are also more efficient when transporting current over large distances

HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmissions are typically used between countries

Most of the electrical circuits used in electronic devices use DC current  
DC is easier to control and allows for more compact circuits  
Some devices like washing machines use both AC and DC current

AC current can be converted to DC current using a Rectifier  
DC current can be converted to AC current using Inverter

DC current is always at its Peak Voltage and flows in one direction  
Invertor can be used to convert Solar Power/ Car Battery into AC current to be used by household appliances  
They are also used on motors/ devices that rotate (Fans, Compressor)
