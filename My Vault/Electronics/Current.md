title: Current

It is the flow of free electrons between atoms in a circuit  
It is measured in a unit called Ampere (Amp)

We need lots of electrons to flow in the same direction to use current  
This can be achieved by applying a [Voltage](voltage.md) difference across the wire

Copper very good conductor of electricity (has loosely bond electron in its outer shell)

There are two types of current : [AC & DC Current](ac-and-dc-current.md)

1 Amp = 1 Coulomb  
1 Coulomb = 6.242 * $10^{18}$ electrons/ sec

Current in an series circuit will be the same everywhere  
The current in a parallel circuit in the branches will be the same of the current available in the circuit
