The verbosity of the scan output by be increased by using -v, -vv & -vvv  
When command is prefixed with "sudo" Nmap uses -sS (Stealth Scan) automatically  
-F : Fast Scan (Scan Top 100 ports)  
If ports are not specified Nmap scans the Top 1000 ports

````bash
nmap -sS -A -T4 -p- -oN <filename> <ip-address>

# Scan and find Vulnerabilities in the services
nmap -sS -sV -T4 -p- --script vuln -oN <filename> <ip-address> 
````

Port scanning uses specially crafted TCP packets to probe the target to collect relevant information

TCP Header without any options is 20 bytes in size  
Nmap Stealth Scans only sets a single option by default and so the header size will be 24 bytes in addition the window size will be set to 1024 which does not match actual traffic and hence can be detected  
Full TCP Scan SYN packets are generated by the OS Network stack and hence will be closer to a real packet

**Full Scan**: Complete 3-Way Handshake  
**Stealth Scan**: SYN, SYN-ACK is followed by RST

### Port States

Open : Service is running on the port and accepting new connections  
Closed : Not accepting new connections but there is an service running on the port  
Filtered : No conclusion. There could be an firewall setup to filter packets
