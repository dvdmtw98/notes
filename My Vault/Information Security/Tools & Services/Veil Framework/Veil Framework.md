### Veil Setup

Two types of Tools

1. **Evasion** : Allows to create undetectable backdoor
2. **Ordnance** : Generates payloads used by evasion (The part of the code that actually achieves what we need)

````bash
sudo apt install veil
veil # Start Veil
````

When starting veil for the 1st time there are a lot of packages that are needed to be installed

````bash
list # View Available Tools
use <number>
````
