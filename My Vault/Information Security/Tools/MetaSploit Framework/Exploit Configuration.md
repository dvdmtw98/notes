### Exploits

```bash
show info
show options

# Advanced Parameters
show advanced

# Set Exploit Options
set <option-name> <value>
```

"setg" can be used to be set options globally for the session (LHOSTS, LPORT, etc.)  
"get" and "getg" can be used to view an options value (get RHOSTS)  
Options can be reset using the "unset" and "unsetg" command

### Payloads

Payloads are of two types Staged and Non-stagged  
Staged Payloads in Metasploit contain Multiple Slashes: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`  
While Non-staged Payloads don't have Slashes: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

Payloads can perform various actions on the target including setting up a Shell

````bash
# Show Payloads
show payloads

# Select Payload
set payload <payload-name>
````

After selecting payload additional options can be set using "show options" command
