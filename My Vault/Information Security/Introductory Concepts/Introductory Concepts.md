**Information Security**: Protecting the data stored in the system  
**Information System Security**: Protecting the system that holds the data

**SIEM**: Security Incident and Event Management  
**SOAR**: Security Orchestration and Automated Response  

**XDR**: Extended Detection and Response (Network)  
**EDR**: Endpoint Detection and Response (Code)

### CIA Triad

**Confidentiality**  
Information has not been disclosed to unauthorized people  
Encryption, Access Control, Authentication, Authorization, Physical Protection

**Integrity**  
Information not modified or altered without right authorization  
Hash, ECC, Backup

**Availability**  
Information can be accessed, stored and protected at all times  
Redundancy, Physical Protection

### AAA

AAA framework also refers to Authentication, Authorization & Accounting  
Unlike CIA Triad - Assurance, Authenticity and Anonymity are independent of each other  

**Assurance**  
How trust is provided and managed in online systems  
Policies, Permissions and Protections

**Authenticity**  
Determine that the statements, policies and permissions that are issued are genuine  
Digital Signatures

**Anonymity**  
Records or transactions cannot be attributed to any individual  
Aggregation, Mixing, Proxies, Pseudonyms

### Security Threats

Malware  
Unauthorized Access  
System Failure  
Social Engineering

Eavesdropping - Confidentiality  
Alteration - Integrity  
DoS - Availability  
Masquerading - Spoofing (Authenticity), Phishing (Confidentiality, Anonymity)  
Correlation & Traceback - Anonymity

### Migrating Threats

Physical Controls  
Technical Controls  
Administrative Controls - Procedural Controls, Legal & Regulatory Controls
