### Example 1

$23^3 \mod 30$  
This equation can also be represented as $-7^3 \mod 30$  
= $-7^2 \ast -7 \mod 30$  
= $-133 \mod 30$  
= $17 \mod 30$  
= 17

### Example 2

When the difference between the numbers is very large we can find the modulus values for the factors of the power and then multiply them all together

$88^7 \mod 187$

= $88^1 \mod 187 = 88$  
= $88^2 \mod 187 = 7744 \mod 187 = 77$  
= $88^4 \mod 187 = 5929 \mod 187 = 132$

= $88^7 \mod 187 = 88^4 \ast 88^2 \ast 88^1 \mod 187 = 894432 \mod 187$  
= 11
