It is a stateless application layer protocol  
Used for the transmission of resources (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) over TCP connection  
Uses client server model for communication (Client : Browser, Server : Server)  

Resources are uniquely identified using a URL/ URI

### HTTP Requests

Sample Request : `GET /home.html HTTP/1.1`

HTTP Method : Used to specify what the client should do  
HTTP Version : Version of HTTP  
Path : Location of file/ document  
HTTP Headers

### HTTP Responses

Sample Response : `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

HTTP Version : Version of HTTP  
Status Code : Code specifying the status of the request  
HTTP Headers

### HTTP Headers

**Additional information** used by the client and the server to specify information needed to send with the request and response so that it is processed correctly  
The headers are defined as **key value pairs**

### HTTP Versions

<u>HTTP 1.0</u>  
Reset Connection after every request

<u>HTTP 1.1</u>  
Keep connection open until all resources are fetched  
Can only fetch single resource at a time

Added support for pipelining which allows client to send multiple requests at once
The request also had to be received in the same order  
Was difficult to implement and had other issues (Head-of-line Blocking) hence was eventually removed

<u>HTTP 2.0</u>  
Added Streams which allows to send multiple streams of data in a single TCP connection  
Each stream is independent of each other and can be received in any order  
Allows to request multiple resources at the same time

<u>HTTP 3.0</u>  
New protocol that uses [QUIC](../../Networking/TCP-IP%20Layers/4%20-%20Transport%20Layer%20Protocols/QUIC%20%28Quick%20UDP%20Internet%20Connections%29.md) instead of TCP  
QUIC is based on [UDP](../../Networking/TCP-IP%20Layers/4%20-%20Transport%20Layer%20Protocols/UDP%20%28User%20Datagram%20Protocol%29.md) protocol  
All quick streams share the same connection and hence multiple handshakes are not required  
QUIC has an concept of Connection ID which allows uses to switch networks quickly and reliably
