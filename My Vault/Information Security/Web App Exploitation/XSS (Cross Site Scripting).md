It is a code injection attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in another user's browser.

The attacker does not directly target his victim. Instead, he exploits a vulnerability in a website that the victim visits, in order to get the website to deliver the malicious JavaScript for him.

To the victim's browser, the malicious JavaScript appears to be a legitimate part of the website, and the website has thus acted as an unintentional accomplice to the attacker

### Detecting XSS

Similar to SQL Injection try out all the input field and URL with parameters to see if they can execute any JS code

### Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS)

This is one of the most commonly used method to see if the site is vulnerable to XSS

```html
<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">
```

#### Reflected XSS

Works when the target loads an URL that is specially crafted by the attacker  
Affects input fields and URLs that have parameters. If the input fields are not sanitized then we can enter a JS script which will get executed when submitted

[Example Link (Reflected XSS)](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22Hello%20World%22)%3C/script%3E)

#### Persistent/ Stored XSS

Store the malicious code in DB. If the contents of the DB are shown on a page and any user opens that page the code will get executed on their device  
Works when there is an input field whose data is stored in DB and that data can be accesses later

<u>Example 1</u>:  
Insert the BeEF Hook URL into the fields to be saved in DB  
Now anyone visiting the page which shows the DB contents are going to hooked in BeEF

<u>Example 2</u>:  
In a request send to the server we can add an header called which can be used to perform persistent XSS (Works for "X-Forwarded-For" header as well)

```html
"True-Client-IP" : <iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">
``` 

Both these headers inform the server of the IP Address of the device. So in place of the IP Address that will be stored on the site we are able to store XSS code

#### DOM based XSS

Focuses on client side script processing. The script needs to be in an language that is processed on the client side like HTML, CSS. This attack happens on the client side not on the server.

Can be dangerous as it happens on client side because of which the server side input validation is not performed  
Generally found on pages that refresh the content without reloading the page (Perform action without accessing server)

```html
<img src="" onerror="alert('Hello World')" />
```

This attack can mostly be found on search bars that load results without refreshing the page
