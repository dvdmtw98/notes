Process is the running instance of an executable program  
Daemon is a process that runs in the background and is not interactive  
Daemons are called as **Services** on Windows

Services on the system are managed using a Service Manager (Systemd)  
Systemd is the first process started by the kernel and has PID 1  
The first process that starts on the system is called as the Init process  
Each service in systemd is managed/ created using a file called **Unit**

````bash
systemctl <operation> <service-name>
````

**<u>Operations</u>**:

* start/ stop/ kill
* enable/ disable (Enable allows a service to start on boot)
* status
* is-active/ is-enabled (View status as a one-liner)
* restart/ reload (Restart service. Reload is not supported by all service)
* mask/ unmask (Prevent daemon from starting up using mask)

````bash
# Only show units that are parsed/ loaded
systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled
systemctl list-units
systemctl list-dependencies

# View Logs generated by systemd
journalctl -xe
````

### Runlevels

Runlevels are used to represent a states of the system  
They are group of units that need to be started in order to be in a particular state  
The "multi-user.target" is an state the system has to be in for user to login and use the system

````shell
# Switch to a different runtime level
systemctl isolate rescue.target
````

|Runtime Level|Target|
|-------------|------|
|0|poweroff.target|
|1|rescue.target|
|2, 3, 4|multi-user.target|
|5|graphical.target|
|6|restart.target|
