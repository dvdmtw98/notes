### Fetch the details of doctors who work in the same hospital but in different specialty

![Doctor Table|900](../images/doctor-table.png)

<u>Approach</u>  
Whenever we need to compare each record in a table with itself we need to make use of self join  
As we don't want to compare a record with itself extra condition for not checking same ids need to be added

````sql
SELECT d1.name, d1.speciality, d1.hospital
FROM doctors d1
JOIN doctors d2
ON d1.id <> d2.id AND d1.hospital = d2.hospital AND d1.speciality <> d2.speciality
ORDER BY d1.id;
