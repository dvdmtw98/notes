### GovCloud

An isolated region to run [FedRAMP](../gcp-security-services/gcp-compliance-standards.md#Federal%20Risk%20and%20Authorization%20Management%20Program%20(FedRAMP)) workloads  
These types of clouds generally have a smaller service offering, lower service availability and higher operational costs

### GCP Approach

GCP allows [FedRAMP](../gcp-security-services/gcp-compliance-standards.md#Federal%20Risk%20and%20Authorization%20Management%20Program%20(FedRAMP)) workloads to run in its normal user regions  
This approach mitigates the issues of other GovCloud offerings  
GCP Regions will be authorized for either High or Moderate baselines
