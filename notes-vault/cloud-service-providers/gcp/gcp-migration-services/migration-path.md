* Catalog Apps
* Educate your organization about GCP
* Experiment and Design Proofs of Concept (PoC)
* Calculate Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
* Choose which workloads to migrate first

### Plan
In the plan phase, you provision and configure the cloud infrastructure and services that will support your workloads on Google Cloud

* Establish user and service identities
* Design your resource organizations
* Define groups and roles for resource access
* Design your network topology and establish connectivity

### Deploy
In the deploy phase implement a deployment process and refine it during the migration

* Fully manual deployments
* Configuration Management Tools (CM)
* Container Orchestration
* Deployment Automation
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Optimize
The optimize phase start optimizing your target environment

* Build and train your team
* Monitor everything
* Automate everything
* Codify everything
* Use managed services instead of self-managed ones
* Optimize for performance and scalability
* Reduce Costs
