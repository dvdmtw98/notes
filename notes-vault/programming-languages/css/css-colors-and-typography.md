### Colors

Create Design with only Black and White Colors  
Add one color from image on site or based on theme  
Use colors that are part of the same shade family  
Bring in Complementary Colors as required sparingly (Use to grab attention)

### Fonts

Serif: Have small lines at the ends are mostly used in printed documents  
San-serif: Looks good on computers and easy to read  
Monospace : Each character in the font uses the same space (Used in IDEs)
