### Syllable
Smallest unit of sound in a language.  
Each syllable can only have one **vowel sound** (nucleus).  
Consonants can come before (onset) or after (coda) the vowel.

### Rhythm
Two or more words that have the same ending sound.  
Usually appear at the end of lines but can also have internal rhythm.

> [!INFO]- End Rhythm  
> Bid me to weep, and I will **weep**  
> While I have eyes to **see**  
> And having none, yet I will **keep**  
> A heart to weep for **thee**

> [!INFO]- Internal Rhythm
> I **drove** myself to the lake / and **dove** into the water.
> 
>  I went to **town** to buy a **gown**.

### Meter
Rhythmic structure of a poem.  
Repeating pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables.  
Meter is built from a series of feet.

### Feet
Small unit in the rhythm pattern.  
They are usually 2-3 syllables long.  

- **Iamb (da‑DUM)**: an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.
    - Representation: `x /`
    - Example: “To BE or NOT to BE, that IS the QUEStion.”
- **Trochee (DUM‑da)**: a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one.
    - Representation: `/ x`
    - Example: “TYger TYger, BURning BRIGHT, / In the FIRest NIGHT of NIGHT.”
- **Anapest (da‑da‑DUM)**: two unstressed then one stressed.
    - Representation: `x x /`
    - Example: “In the DEPTHs of the MIDnight, I found my own SKIN.”
- **Dactyl (DUM‑da‑da)**: one stressed followed by two unstressed.
    - Representation: `/ x x`
    - Example: “EL‑e‑gant LY‑ri‑cal MEA‑sure of HEAR‑tbeat and MEET‑ing.”

### Verse
A single line of poem (traditionally).  
Sometimes used to mean stanza (group of lines) or the entire poem.  
Note: `/` is used to indicate line break and `//` denotes stanza break.

**Free Verse**  
Poetry without set meter or rhyme.  
Similar to natural speech. Contains lines with varying lengths.  
May contain internal rhythm but not necessary.

> [!INFO]- "Fog" by Carl Sandburg
> The fog comes  
> on little cat feet.  
> It sits looking  
> over harbor and city  
> on silent haunches  
> and then moves on.  

**Black Verse**  
Poetry that has a set meter but no rhyme.  
They do not contain any end rhythm as the composition is more flexible.  

> [!INFO]- “Mending Wall” by Robert Frost  
> “Something there is that doesn't love a wall,  
> That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,  
> And spills the upper boulders in the sun;”
