#### Multi-Factor Authentication
A security system that requires more than one method of authentication from <u>independent categories of credentials</u> to certify the user's identity

#### Authentication Factors

##### Knowledge-based Factor
Also known as <u>Type 1</u> or "<u>Something you Know</u>" factor  
Least Security, Cheapest Solution  
e.g. Password, PIN  

##### Possession-based Factor
Also known as <u>Type 2</u> or "<u>Something you Have</u>" factor  
e.g. Smart Card, Hardware Token (Key Fob), Software Token (OTP)

##### Inheritance-based Factor
Also known as <u>Type 3</u> or "<u>Something you Are</u>" factor  
High security, High Cost, Error Prone  
Once compromised it cannot be replaced  
e.g. Biometrics (Fingerprints, Facial, Iris Scan), Behavioral (Typing Style, Walking Style, Signature, Voice Recognition)

##### Location-based Factor
Also known as <u>Type 4</u> or "<u>Somewhere you Are</u>" factor  
e.g. IP Address Verification, GPS Tracking

##### Behaviour-based Factor
Also known as <u>Type 5</u> or "<u>Something you Do</u>" factor  
e.g. Keystroke Pattern, Mouse Movement

#### Passkeys
Users can create and access online accounts without needing to input a password  
To log into a service the user must unlock their device using the authentication method they have set (e.g. biometrics)
