Continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plans and evaluating their effectiveness during a projects lifecycle

##### Residual Risk
Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation, transference or acceptance measures on the initial risk  
Leftover Risk after mitigation is implemented

##### Secondary Risk
They are new risks that arise from that risk mitigation implementation  
We need to mitigate those to an acceptable level as well

##### Control Risk
Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time

##### Risk Reporting
Process of communicating information about risk management activities  

Helps to:  
* Informed Decision-Making  
* Risk Mitigation  
* Stakeholder Communication  
* Regulatory Compliance
