#### Usage

```
| rest /services/saved/searches

| rest /services/saved/searches splunk_server=local count=2
```

The above syntax will only show results from the app in which the query is executed. The `servucesNS` endpoint has to be used to specify the user and app context.

```
| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches
```

The first `-` is the user context and the second `-` is the app context.
