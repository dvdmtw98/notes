Used to enrich the indexed data by bringing in additional fields from external sources.  
Once we create a lookup definition we do not need to use the filename/path in the query.  

Auto Lookup will automatically add the additional fields from the lookup.  
Will be resource intensive when used on large datasets.  

```
index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| lookup ip_org_lookup IP AS clientip OUTPUT org_name, region
| table clientip status org_name region
```

`IP`: Name of field in lookup  
`clientip`: Name of field in Events

Lookups can also be used to filter data by using it in a [[splunk-subsearch|subsearch]].  

```
index=_myindex sourcetype=mytype [ 
	| inputlookup mylookup.csv 
	| table ip 
	| rename ip as src_ip 
]
```

The portion inside the subsearch is returned in the format `key=value`.

The `outputlookup` command can save results from a query as a CSV lookup.
