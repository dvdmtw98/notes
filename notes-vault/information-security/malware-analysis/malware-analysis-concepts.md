### Malware Analysis Goal
The primary goal of malware analysis is to create signatures that can be used to detect the malware.

#### Host-based Signatures
Indicators used to detect malware on victim hosts.  
Detect files created/modified by malware or specific changes made in the registry.  
Focuses on what the malware does on the system and is often more effective at detecting malware that changes form.  
Antivirus signatures focus on the characteristics of the malware.  

#### Network Signatures
Detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic.

### Malware Analysis Techniques

#### Static Analysis
Basic static analysis involves analyzing the malware without viewing the actual instructions.  
Informs us whether a file is malicious and what are its functionality.  
It can be used to create basic network signatures.
Not very helpful when dealing with complex malware as we could easily miss critical functionalities of the program.

Advanced malware analysis involves loading the program into a disassembler and looking at the programs instructions.  

#### Dynamic Analysis
Basic dynamic analysis involves running the malware and observing its behavior on the system.  
It is helpful in understand what the malware has done on the system which helps in removing the infection.  
It is also useful in producing effective signatures.  

Advanced dynamic analysis involves using a debugger to look at the internal state of the malware when its running.
