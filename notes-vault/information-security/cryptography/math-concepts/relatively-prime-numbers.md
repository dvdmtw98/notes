Two numbers are said to relatively prime, if their only common factor is 1  
If GCD(a, b) = 1 then a and b are relatively prime numbers  
They are also called co-prime numbers

The 2 numbers that are relatively prime need not be prime numbers  
e.g. 8 and 9 are co-prime even though neither of them is a prime number
