### Nihilism
Questions the fundamental meaning and nature of existence  
Suggests that life lacks inherent meaning or significance  
Challenges traditional believes: morality and nature of reality  

Nihilism can also be a mode of liberation is it frees us from the constraints of traditional values and believes. This inspires a more authentic mode of existence    

#### Moral Nihilism
Rejects the existence of moral truths (good & evil - human constructs)  
No universal run governing what is right and wrong  
Ethical judgements are subjective or culturally determined  

#### Existential Nihilism
Delves into the ultimate meaning of human existence (life) and the universe  
Life is devoid of any intrinsic meaning and trying to find meaning is futile  
This outlook can make you sad and depressed  

### Absurdism
Acknowledges the lack of meaning in the universe and suggests to accept the absurdity of the human condition  
They also believe that humans can find meaning and fulfillment by embarrassing life’s uncertainty  
Accept the absurdness with courage and defiance rather than succumbing to despair and nihilism  

### Utilitarianism
Proposes that the best action is the one that maximizes happiness or wellbeing for the greatest number of people  
Focuses on the outcome of actions and consequences instead of inherent principles or rules  
Utility: Happiness, Pleasure or absence of suffering  

#### Act Utilitarianism
Each action is evaluated based on its consequence and choose the one that leads to the greatest overall utility  

#### Rule Utilitarianism
Moral rules or principles should be followed based on which would lead to the greatest overall utility when consistently applied  

### Objectivism
Believe in objective reality, reason and individualism  
Facts are facts irrespective of a persons beliefs or wish’s  
Rational thinking, logic and evidence and important tools of guiding human action  
Self-interest is not inherently selfish or immoral but rather a national expression of human nature  
Emphasis individualism over collectivism  

### Determinism
All events (including human action) is determined by causes external to the will  
Every event and action takes place according to a chain of event that is determined by the preceding causes and conditions and governed by natural laws  
Challenges the notion of free will  

#### Casual Determinism
Every event is necessitated by preceding events and laws  
Human behavior is determined by generics and neuro-chemistry

#### Psychological Determinism
Humans actions are determined by psychological factors - unconscious drive, conditioning  

#### Environmental Determinism
Human behavior is shaped by culture, society and living environment

### Empiricism
Emphasis on sensory experience and observations as primary knowledge of the world  
Sensory experience services as the foundation for acquiring information about the external world  
Empiricism is closely linked with the scientific method of thinking  

### Rationalism
Reason and rationality is placed at the primary means of attaining knowledge and understanding reality  
States that certain truths can be gained independently without the need of sensory experience  

### Existentialism
Focuses on individuals freedom and experiences in a seemingly absurd world  
Believe that individuals have the freedom to create their own meaning and identity  
Authenticity: Living as ones true self, values and believes rather than confining to societal expectations and norms  

### Stoicism
Encourages virtues: Courage, Wisdom, Moderation and Justice  
Accept the natural order of nature and understand what is in their control and what is not  
Encourages to live in the present moment and letting go of worries about the past and future
