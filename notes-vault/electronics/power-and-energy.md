### Watt
It is the unit of power.  
It conveys the amount of power that is consumed by a device at a given moment.  
It is similar to the speed of a car at a given movement (e.g. 60 km/h).  
1 Watt = 1 Joule/sec

Watt-hour measures the power that is consumed in an hour.  
It is similar to the concept of distance traveled.  

Power (W) = Current (A) \* Voltage (V)  
kW (Kilowatts) = Watts \* 1000  
 
Energy (kWh) = Power (kW) * Time (hour)  

### Joule
Joules is unit of energy or work.  
Joules is the energy dissipated as heat when a current of 1 Amp passes through a resister of 1 Ohm for 1 second.
