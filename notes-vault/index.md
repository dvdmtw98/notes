**Welcome to [Digital Archive](https://notes.davidvarghese.net)**. This is where I dump notes, tutorials, and random things I’m learning, exploring, or just find fascinating. It’s a messy-but-organized collection that I have cobbled together over time. Feel free to poke around.

There are multiple ways to navigate Digital Archive:  
🔍 **Search** for anything with **`Ctrl+K`** (or just type in the search bar).  
📄 **Click notes** to read details, and follow links to see how topics connect.  
🌿 **Check out the graph**; it’s a visual representation of how my notes relate.  
🏷️ **Browse tags** to quickly jump between topics.  

This isn’t a polished guide; it’s built for my own sanity, but I am sharing it in case it helps others. **Spot a mistake? Have a suggestion?** Let me know!
