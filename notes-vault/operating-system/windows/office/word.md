Add the `Next Page (Section Break)`.  
Section Breaks allow us to use different alignments in different sections.  
This will prevent the alignment from being allowed to the rest of the document.

This causes a special invisible element to be added on the page.

If you want to see the visible divider, go to `Home → Hide/Show`.  
Shortcut: `Ctrl + *`.
