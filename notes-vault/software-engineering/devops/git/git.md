### Internal Structure

Git Repo consist of three types of objects: Blobs, Trees and Commits  
Blobs: Object IDs (OID) that contain the file content  
Tress: OID that points to other blobs or trees. It is recursive structure. It includes the modes and type of the object  
Commit: It is an OID that contains the commit related information

````bash
# Returns OID/ Hash of Object
git rev-parse HEAD:file-name

# Returns content of the object
git cat-file -p OID
git cat-file -p HEAD:file-name

# Returns the SHA Hash of a object
git hash-object -w file-name
````

These details are stored inside the object directory  
The Git database is a very complex key value store
