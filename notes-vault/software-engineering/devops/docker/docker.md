### Miscellaneous Points

* Containers are only alive till the command that started the container is running
* When we specify an command at the end of the "docker run" command it will overwrite the default startup command of the container
* It is best practice to create a new network for each application
* The default network driver used by Docker is Bridge. The default bridge does not have a DNS Server. To overcome this issue the `--link` flag can be used which allows to link containers that need to communicate with each other together
* When we run a container an new read/ write layer is added over the base image (a new copy of base image is not created) because of this only extra space for the new layer is required
