#### Conventional Current
Electrons flow from positive to negative end according to this theory  
This is not what actually happens

#### Electron Flow
Electrons flow from negative to positive end  
This is what actually occurs

In a circuit the electrons are flowing from the negative end towards the positive end  
Even though wrong conventional current is the theory that is mostly used

But this direction does not matter as the formulas that are used do not take the direction into account
