#### GovCloud
An isolated region to run [[gcp-compliance-standards#Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)|FedRAMP]] workloads  
These types of clouds generally have a smaller service offering, lower service availability and higher operational costs

#### GCP Approach
GCP allows [[gcp-compliance-standards#Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)|FedRAMP]] workloads to run in its normal user regions  
This approach mitigates the issues of other GovCloud offerings  
GCP Regions will be authorized for either High or Moderate baselines
