##### Asset Value (AV)
The cost of an asset  
Asset includes Tangible and Intangible objects

##### Exposure Factor (EF)
Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event  
Represented as a percentage between 0% (No Loss) and 100% (Total Loss)

##### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event  
SLE = AV \* EF

##### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year

##### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected annual loss from a risk  
ALE = SLE \* ARO

##### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
Expected annual cost from implementing the mitigation strategies
