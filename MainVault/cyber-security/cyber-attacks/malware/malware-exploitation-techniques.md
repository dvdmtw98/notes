Modern malware use **fileless** techniques to evade detection based on signature

**Dropper or Downloader**  
Shellcode executed on target system  
Shellcode refers to malware code that gives the attacker a shell 

**Maintain Access**: Add infected system into C2 server  
**Strengthen Access**: Try to compromise other system of higher values  
**Actions on Objectives**: Achieve there goal/motive  
**Concealment**: Erase traces of entry into system

#### Malware Delivery Techniques
**Masquerading**: Replace genuine executable with malicious executable  
**DDL Injection**: Load malicious code during the load of an DLL  
**DLL Sideloading**: Make program load malicious DDL by modifying its manifest  
**Process Hollowing**: Load process in suspected state then unmap/hollow its memory location and rewrite it with malicious code. Takes over a place in memory

#### Living Off the Land (LOTL)
Exploitation technique that uses standard system tools and packages to perform intrusions
Detecting adversaries that use this techniques is quite difficult as they are executing malware code using tools and processes that come standard on OSes
