#### Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
Systems used to monitor and control industrial processes  
The systems can be simple systems that control heating and cooling to systems that control entire production processes  
Used in electrical, water, oil and gas industries

##### Distributed Control Systems (DCS)
Used to control production systems in a single location

##### Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
Used to control specific processes like production line and assembly

#### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
A type of ICS used to monitor and control geographically dispersed industrial processes  
Used in electrical, distribution, water, oil and gas pipelines  

#### System Risks & Threats

* Unauthorized Access
* Malware Attacks
* Lack of Updates
