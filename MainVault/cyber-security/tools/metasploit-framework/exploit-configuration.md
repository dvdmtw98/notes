### Exploits

```bash
show info
show options

# Advanced Parameters
show advanced

# Set Exploit Options
set <option-name> <value>
```

`setg`, `getg` and `unsetg` allow to configure values globally  
Some exploits have a `check` command that can be used to check if host is vulnerable

### Payloads

Payloads are of two types Staged and Non-stagged  
Staged Payloads in Metasploit contain Multiple Slashes: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`  
While Non-staged Payloads don't have Slashes: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

Payloads can perform various actions on the target including setting up a Shell

````bash
# Show Targets
show targets

# Show Payloads
show payloads

# Select Payload
set payload <payload-name>
````
