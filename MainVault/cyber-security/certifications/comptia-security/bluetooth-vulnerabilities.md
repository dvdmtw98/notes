Wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances without the need for an Internet connection

### Bluetooth Vulnerabilities

##### Insecure Pairing
Devices establish a connection without proper authentication

##### Device Spoofing
Attacker impersonates a device to trick a user into connecting

##### On-Path Attacks
Exploits Bluetooth protocol to intercept and alter communications between devices without either party being aware

### Bluetooth Attacks

##### Bluejacking
Sending of unsolicited messages to Bluetooth enabled devices

##### Bluesnarfing
Unauthorized access to information from a wireless device over a Bluetooth connection  
Takes information from an Bluetooth enabled device

##### Bluebugging
A more advanced form of Bluesnarfing which allows the attacker to take control of device  
The attacker can make calls, send text message's as well as access the internet

##### Bluesmack
Type of DoS attack that uses a specially crafted Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol packet to target a device

##### Blueborne
Set of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology that can allow an attacker to take over devices or spread malware

### Security Best Practices

Turning off Bluetooth  
Set device to "Non-discoverable" mode  
Only pair with known and trusted devices  
Always use unique PIN or passkeys for authentication  
Be cautious of unsolicited connection requests  
Use encryption when sending sensitive data
