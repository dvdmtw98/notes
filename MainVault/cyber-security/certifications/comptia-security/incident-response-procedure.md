**Event**: An observable change in state  
**Alert**: Triggers warnings if certain event happens  
**Incident**: Multiple adverse events happening on our systems or network  
**Problem**: Incident with an unknown cause  

**Inconvenience**: Non-disruptive failures  
**Emergency**: Urgent. A crisis  
**Disaster**: Entire facility is unusable for 24 hours or longer  
**Catastrophe**: Our facility is destroyed

#### Preparation
Involves strengthening systems and networks to resist attacks  
This phase is about getting ready for future incidents

#### Detection
Events are analyzed to determine if they might be a security incident
Stakeholders are informed, containment begins and initial response actions are taken

#### Containment (Response)
Limit the incidents impact by securing data and protecting business operations  

#### Eradication (Mitigation)
We understand the cause of the incident  
We clean the system and fix the vulnerabilities that there discovered  

#### Reporting
We report throughout the Incident Response procedure beginning with Detection  
Includes the technical and non-technical reports

#### Recovery
Restores systems and services to their secure state after an incident  
e.g. Restoring Backups, Installing Patches, Implementing Security Configuration

#### Remediation
Starts during the Mitigation phase  
In remediation we fix the flaws that caused on incident on all the other systems

#### Post-Incident Activity
Happens after containment, eradication and full system recovery  

##### Root-Cause Analysis
Identifies the incidents source and how to prevent it in the future

Steps Involved:
* Define the scope of the incident  
* Determine the causal relationships  
* Identify an effective solution  
* Implement and track the solution

##### Lesson Learned
Document experiences during incidents in a formalized way

##### After-action Report
Collects formalized information about what occurred
