### Penetration Testing

#### Physical Pentesting
Testing an organizations physical security through testing locks, access cards, security cameras and other protective measures

#### Offensive Pentesting
Also called **Red Teaming**  
Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities

#### Defensive Pentesting
Also called as **Blue Teaming**  
Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks and enhancing incident response times

#### Integrated Pentesting
Also called as **Purple Teaming**  
Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test

### Pentesting Environments

#### Known Environment
Detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received  
Evaluate vulnerabilities and weakness in known systems  
Similar to an Insider Threat attack

#### Partially Known Environment
Limited information provided to testers who may have patrial knowledge of the system  
Aim is to identify vulnerabilities in both known and hidden assets  
Scenario attack has gained some information through a previous attack

#### Unknown Environment
Testers receive minimal to no information about the target system  
Mimic a real-work attack where attacker has limited information about assets
