* **Instance Attributes** : These attributes are declared inside the `__init__` method of the class. They are difference for each instance of the class
* **Class Attributes** : These attributes are declared in the body of the class but not inside a method. They are common to all instances of the class

 > [!note]
 > * Class attributes can behave like static attributes if accessed only using the Class name
 > * Accessing class attribute using the instance object cause a new instance attribute with the same name as the class attribute to be created
