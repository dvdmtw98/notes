### Preprocessing  
Preprocessor obeys commands that start with **`#`** (Preprocessor Directives)  
Directives are commands that can edit and modify the program prior to compilation  
e.g. `#include`, `#define`

### Compiling  
The compiler translates the output of the preprocessor into machine code  
All the comments in the code are replaced with a space

### Linking
Linker combines object code with additional code to generate a executable program  
This process includes addition of library functions
