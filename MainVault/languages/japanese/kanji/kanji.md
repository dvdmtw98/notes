### Kanji

It is the use of Chinese Characters in Japanese writing  
An Kanji represents an idea or a meaning  
Each Kanji can have multiple meanings based on the context in which they are used

An Kanji character can be broken down into smaller characters called `Radicals`  
Every kanji character has at least one radical

Each Kanji has two reads : On (ニン) and Kun (ひと)  
On reading is mimics the original sound made in Chinese  
Which Kun reading is the revised Japanese reading

"On" readings are generally used when multiple Kanji characters are grouped together into a compound word  
"Kun" readings will be used when its an standalone Kanji
