A device that allows to connect network devices together  
Old device rarely used nowadays (Replaced by [[switch|Switch]]es)  


It is also called Multi-Port [[repeater|Repeater]] as traffic that is received a port and is broadcasted to all devices connected to the Hub  
Because of this devices that are connected to an hub can see each others packets  
Hubs can lead to increased network errors (Large Collision Domain)

Hubs make use of Half Duplex Communication i.e. only one device can communicate at a time

**Passive Hub**: Repeats signal with no amplification  
**Active Hub**: Repeats signal with amplification  
**Smart Hub**: Active Hub with enhanced features like SNMP
